# Deployment Directory

This directory contains deployment-related documentation, scripts, and configuration files.

## Folder Structure

### docs/
- `deployment.md` - Main deployment documentation and guides

### scripts/
- Deployment scripts (to be added)

## Deployment Documentation

### Main Deployment Guide
The `docs/deployment.md` file contains comprehensive information about:
- Deployment strategies and options
- Environment setup requirements
- Build and deployment processes
- Production configuration
- Monitoring and maintenance procedures

## Deployment Process

### Prerequisites
Before deployment, ensure:
- All dependencies are properly installed
- Environment variables are configured
- Database migrations are applied
- Build process is tested

### Build Process
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the application
npm run build

# Run database migrations
npm run db:push

# Start the application
npm start
```

### Deployment Scripts
Deployment scripts will be added to the `scripts/` folder as needed:
- `deploy.sh` - Main deployment script
- `rollback.sh` - Rollback script for emergency situations
- `setup.sh` - Environment setup script

## Environment Configuration

### Development
- Configuration files in `config/` directory
- Local database setup
- Development server settings

### Production
- Environment-specific configuration
- Production database settings
- Security and performance optimizations

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks
- Application health endpoints
- Database connectivity checks
- Service monitoring

### Logging
- Application logs in `logs/` directory
- System monitoring logs
- Error tracking and alerting

## Adding Deployment Scripts

When adding new deployment scripts:
1. Place them in the `scripts/` folder
2. Make them executable (`chmod +x script.sh`)
3. Update this README with documentation
4. Test scripts in staging environment before production use

## Deployment Best Practices

1. **Version Control**: Always deploy from version control tags
2. **Testing**: Test deployments in staging environment first
3. **Rollback**: Have rollback procedures in place
4. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring and alerting
5. **Documentation**: Keep deployment documentation up to date
6. **Security**: Follow security best practices for production deployments
